Natta
=====

Natta sounds like "natter" and stands for "not another terrible Twitter app".
It is not intended to be an awesome twitter client, just my first attempt at building an Android app with Scala.

    natter [ˈnætə] Chiefly Brit
    vb
    (intr) to talk idly and at length; chatter or gossip
    n
    prolonged idle chatter or gossip

I'm putting it up here because it may also help others trying to write Android apps in Scala. At least you can learn from my mistakes :)

I'm using ScalaForAndroid_ because it seemed like the most recently updated and simplest way to start writing apps in Scala.
